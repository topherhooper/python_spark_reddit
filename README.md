# Python + Spark + Reddit

## Description

This project hopes to serve as an example project of connect the python reddit wrapper [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to the python spark wrapper [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html). The docker-spark directory was taken from [bde/docker-spark](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-spark) to easily start a spark cluster.
